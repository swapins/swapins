# Swapin Vidya 🧬 + 💻
**Systems Architect | Edge AI Researcher | MedTech Innovator**

I bridge the gap between clinical medicine and high-performance computing. With over 7 years of experience in systems architecture and a background in medical sciences (MBBS coursework), my work focuses on deploying "Point-of-Care Intelligence"—bringing complex AI models out of the cloud and onto Edge devices for real-time clinical utility.
