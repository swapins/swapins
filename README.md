**Edge AI Systems Architect | Decentralized Intelligence Research**

I design and prototype computationally efficient AI architectures for deployment on resource-constrained edge systems. My work focuses on bridging high-complexity machine learning models with low-latency, energy-aware execution environments in healthcare, agriculture, and environmental monitoring.

This portfolio documents research prototypes and architectural explorations aligned with long-term Edge-AI system development.
